## Example

> explanation of the example

This example contains 2 source files, `main.c` and `foo.c`. It also contains a header file `foo.h` <br>

In `main.c` we create a simple linkedlist. <br>
In `foo.c` we define a function that prints a linkedlist. <br>

but wait... <br>
we don't have any definition of the linkedlist <br>

To install the linked list we can just `exe -S linkedlist`, substitute `exe` with the path to the binary file <br>

then we can just `make` to compile it to a binary called `example` <br>
